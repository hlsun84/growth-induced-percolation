# growth-induced-percolation
This project contains source codes and data sets from the paper "Growth-induced Percolation on Complex Networks" by H.L. SUN, S.H. Chen, J.R. Xie and Y.Q.Hu.

#1. Source Codes:
The source codes implemented in this project are not strictly along with equations, but with optimization from ER and SF networks.

Generally speaking, there are five parts here, including directed ER and undirected ER networks, directed SF and undirected SF networks, as well as experimental study from hot streaks.
Each part contaisn theoretical study and simulation on extremely large networks.
(1) directed ER networks: direc_ER_numerical.py, direc_ER_simulation.py.
(2) undirected ER networks: un_ER_numerical.py, un_ER_simulation.py.
(3) directed SF networks: direc_SF_numerical.py, direc_SF_simulation.py.
(4) undirected SF networks: un_SF_numerical.py, un_SF_simulation.py.
(5) DBLP scientist collaboration networks: Data file: dblp-v5-1k.txt, Python: hot_streaks.py.
(6) common functions: function_general.py

#2. Python enviroments.
(1) Implementation by Python 3.9 
(2) Dependency: networkx, scipy, numpy, statistics, matplotlib, pandas and function_general.

#3. Inquiry:
For any problems, please contact hlsun84@mail.ustc.edu.cn and we feel happy to give kind support to make your work better.

#4.  Collaboration:
We are open-minded to work with any person who really love percolation theory and applications in Complex Networks.
